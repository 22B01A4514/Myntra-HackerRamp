This repository contains code for an image generation project using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). The project involves generating new images based on specific prompts from a dataset containing dress attributes and images.

## Overview

This project utilizes a Conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate new images based on specific prompts. The dataset contains dress attributes (color, design, etc.) and corresponding images. The goal is to train a GAN model that can generate images matching the given attributes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and loading using PyTorch
- Implementation of both the generator and discriminator networks
- Training loop for the GAN model
- Saving generated images during training
- Evaluation and visualization of the generated images

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- pandas
- tqdm
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
